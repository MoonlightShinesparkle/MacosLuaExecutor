# MacosLuaExecutor
Executes LUA scripts

It was made using LUA (https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/readme.html#changes) [https://www.lua.org] and the MacOs script editor.
This program uses AppleScript to open a terminal window and execute a LUA file opened with the program, leaving you able to execute LUA programs without having to manually input the file on the terminal window.

Usage:
Let's say that you made a LUA script like this:

[Factors.txt](https://github.com/MoonlightShinesparkle/MacosLuaExecutor/files/7972878/Factors.txt)

Set the file's name to [Name goes here].lua to have a lua file

Then, make the file open with LuaExecutor.app

Then, open the file: a terminal window should open without requiring to have LUA installed and it'll run the LUA script

To use this app, simply download the LuaExecutor.app.zip file, open the zip file and it'll be done

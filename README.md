# MacosLuaExecutor
Executes LUA scripts

It was made using LUA (https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/readme.html#changes) [https://www.lua.org] and the MacOs script editor.
This program uses AppleScript to open a terminal window and execute a LUA file opened with the program, leaving you able to execute LUA programs without having to manually input the file on the terminal window.
